                    Bike sharing is a shared transport service using bike on a short term for a price. 
                    The sturdy-framed bikes are available at any docking station in the city. The bikes can be taken
                     from any station and returned to any station in the bike share system. Riders use bike share for
                      commuting to work or leisureâ€”like running errands, going to appointments or meeting up with friends.
                      Riders also can use bike to connect to public transportation or just doing exercise for 
                      exploring the city.<br><br>Weather conditions have considerable influence on cycling travel behavior. 
                      Our goal in this project is to create a viable machine learning model to explore possible correlation(s) 
                      between the different types of weather conditions and the demand on bike sharing.
