# Toronto Bike Sharing Demand Prediction 

## Overview 
Bike sharing is a shared transport service using bike on a short term for a price. The sturdy-framed bikes are available at any docking station in the city. The bikes can be taken from any station and returned to any station in the bike share system. Riders use bike share for commuting to work or leisureâ€”like running errands, going to appointments or meeting up with friends.Riders also can use bike to connect to public transportation or just doing exercise for exploring the city.  

Weather conditions have considerable influence on cycling travel behavior. Our goal in this project is to create a viable machine learning model to explore possible correlation(s) between the different types of weather conditions and the demand on bike sharing. 



### Project Scope: 
:large_orange_diamond: Location      : This Project is based in Toronto

:large_orange_diamond: Time Range    : 3 years history from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021

### Questions we hope to answer: 

* How weather conditions affect the demand of bike sharing in Toronto?
* Which weather condition(s) or feature(s) is having the most impact on the demand of bike sharing in Toronto? 
* Suggestions for next business strategy.  



## Group communication protocols:
* Team members communicate via Slack, Email and Google drive.  
* Responsibilities:
  - Inez Suyono   : ETL, Develop Database

  - Dana Du       : Manage Repo, ETL, Develop Machine Learning

 

 
 
 ## Machine Learning Model  
 ** Preliminary test**: Preliminary test was performed using Dec 2021 sample. We use Linear Regression model to check for possible relationships. As the sample data is relatively small, the outcome was not as we predicted. Further details will be filled when the full cleaned dataset is ready. 
 Next stage will try out different regression models on full cleaned dataset.
 
 ## Data and Database
 Data will consists of two tables, one for bike data and the other is for weather data.
 This data will be extracted from datasource and stored on database using PostGreSQL.
