# Toronto Bike Sharing Demand Prediction 

## Overview: 

Bike sharing is a shared transport service using bike on a short term for a price. The sturdy-framed bikes are available at any docking station in the city. The bikes can be taken from any station and returned to any station in the bike share system. Riders use bike share for commuting to work or leisureâ€”like running errands, going to appointments or meeting up with friends.Riders also can use bike to connect to public transportation or just doing exercise for exploring the city.  

Weather conditions have considerable influence on cycling travel behavior. Our goal in this project is to create a viable machine learning model to explore possible correlation(s) between the different types of weather conditions and the demand on bike sharing.

### Questions we hope to answer: 

* How weather conditions affect the demand of bike sharing in Toronto?
* Which weather condition(s) or feature(s) is having the most impact on the demand of bike sharing in Toronto? 
* Suggestions for next business strategy.

We use Tableau to interactive data visualization with the project to identify some relevant points. We transform the way we see the data to solves those problems below.
